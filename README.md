# KnightScythe
KnightScythe is a toy Battleship implementation written in C#. You can play against the computer, or have two computers fight each other.

It's a rather simplistic program, and was written as a fun exercise to teach myself C#. The feature set is as follows: 

* Full implementation of the classic game Battleship, including placing ships and shooting down opponent ships while the opponent also attacks you
* Really stupidly simple AI that simply attacks random positions (subject to improve, possibly)
* Ability to allow the computer to "play itself".
